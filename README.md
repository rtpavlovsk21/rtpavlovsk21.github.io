## Who I am
I am a radiation detection scientist and engineer. I generally focus on hardware improvements for multichannel radiation detector systems, however I try to work on difficult problems that have large impact.

This image shows the 64 detector semiconductor detector array that MiniPRISM which composes MiniPRISM. The detectors are semiconductor single crystal volumes that are 1cm x 1cm x 1cm. |![MiniPRISMv1 Fukushima](images/minip_fuku.png)
The above is a data collection in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan which shows a data product from a newly constructed parking-lot and adjoining forested area.
