## Who I am
I am a radiation detection scientist and engineer. I generally focus on hardware improvements for multichannel radiation detector systems, however I try to work on difficult problems that have large impact.

## Previous work
NGLAMPv1 flight and first data products |
:--------------------------------------:|
![NGLAMPv1](images/nglamp_pdf.png)
The photo demonstrates the ability of NGLAMP to fly on a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) and perform simultaneous neutron and gamma-ray mapping. This demonstration shows a sheilded neutron source, concealed in its gamma-ray signature by heavy sheilding. Therefore the expected and observed result is a neutron-based localization with a uniform gamma-ray background. Read the seminal, ![Arxiv](https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1908.06114) paper on this system. Additional context is provided in the LAMP ![Arxiv](https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1901.05038) paper.|

MiniPRISM internals		| MiniPRISM dispersed contamination measurement

![MiniPRISMv1](images/minip.png) This image shows the 64 detector semiconductor detector array that MiniPRISM which composes MiniPRISM. The detectors are semiconductor single crystal volumes that are 1cm x 1cm x 1cm. Please watch for our Arxiv publication on this system which flies on sUAS and can be hand-carried.|![MiniPRISMv1 Fukushima](images/minip_fuku.png) The above is a data collection in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan which shows a data product from a newly constructed parking-lot and adjoining forested area. The system is hand-carried in this case, as flying sUAS internationally is a bit of a trick! This measurement shows that contamination is found in the low-lying areas sloping away from the newly constructed parking-lot.
